	//To actually be able to display anything with three.js, we need three things: A scene, a camera, and a renderer so we can render the scene with the camera.

	var scene = new THREE.Scene();

	//There are a few different cameras in three.js. For now, we will use the PerspectiveCamera
		//THREE.PerspectiveCamera( <FIELD VIEW> , <ASPECT RATIO>, <near clipping plane>, <far clipping plane> )
			//Clipping Planes: What that means, is that objects further away from the camera than the value of far or closer than near won't be rendered.
		var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 30, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );

	//three.js comes with a few other options other than WebGLRenderer, used as fallbacks for users with older browsers
		var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

		//determines the size at which we want to render our app
		//you're going to want to reduce the size for performance intense apps
		// you can also look up how to pass in arguments here to reduce the resolution
			renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
			
				//add the renderer to the html (the canvas element)
				$('body').append( renderer.domElement );

	//we make the cube here!

			var cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
		
			//add cube to the scene
			//by default it gets added to (0,0,0) - b/c of this the camera and cube are inside each other
				scene.add(cube);

		//where's the camera relative to the cube?
			camera.position.z = 5;

	//Anything you want to move or change while the app is running has to go through the render loop. This runs 60 times per second.
